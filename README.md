# WIKIPEDIA SCRAPER
## Becode project to build a scraper to retrieve data from Wikipedia
## Author: Jordi Batlle

## The Mission

Create a scraper that builds a JSON file with the political leaders of each country you get from [this API](https://country-leaders.onrender.com/docs).
Include in this file the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page of these leaders (you'll retrieve the Wikipedia page URL from the API, which you then have to scrape yourself).

### Features

- You should have a working `wikipedia_scraper.ipynb` notebook that calls the API and creates a JSON file
- Create your own exception to include proper exception handling
- Have a nice README that explains your project.
- A switch to store the output as CSV instead of JSON

### Guidelines:
This project follows the guidelines from [Wikipedia Scraper](https://github.com/becodeorg/BXL-Bouman-9/tree/main/projects/01-TheField/wikipedia_scraper).
